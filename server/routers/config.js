// Overview
// Signing in should route to profile from where they can route to list of 
// availble chat messages, which then routes to individual chat rooms
// so implement react router to handle all this and facilitate chat 
// functionality development

// Steps
// Implement react router and ensure we are routing to each necessary component
// Each routed component can be a very, very basic skeleton. It will be easier for
// us to develop rest of project if we are routing to components and the flow is clear.
// then develop basic UI for chat components and profile.
